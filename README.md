# R-project
In this project, we performed modeling of the historic sale price of the Toyota Corolla sedan and built a prediction model. To improve the prediction performance and cope
with the multicollinearity issue, we utilized a ridge model, LASSO model, and variable selection method. Through the analysis, the selected ordinary least square model is
found to be inadequate with deficiencies such as non-constant variance and nonlinearity. After transformation, the resulting linear model fulfills the goal and performs 
much better in testing data, compared to the ridge model and the originalmodel. Here is the original code: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgahancepel/toyota-corolla
